  abstract        = {CycleGAN (Zhu et al. 2017) is one recent successful approach to learn a transformation between two image distributions. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate an intriguing property of the model: CycleGAN learns to "hide" information about a source image into the images it generates in a nearly imperceptible, high-frequency signal. This trick ensures that the generator can recover the original sample and thus satisfy the cyclic consistency requirement, while the generated image remains realistic. We connect this phenomenon with adversarial attacks by viewing CycleGAN's training procedure as training a generator of adversarial examples and demonstrate that the cyclic consistency loss causes CycleGAN to be especially vulnerable to adversarial attacks.},

Recent advances in semantic segmentation have enabled their application to medical image segmentation. While most CNNs use two-dimensional kernels, recent CNN-based publications on medical image segmentation featured three-dimensional kernels, allowing full access to the three-dimensional structure of medical images. Though closely related to semantic segmentation, medical image segmentation includes specific challenges that need to be addressed, such as the scarcity of labelled data, the high class imbalance found in the ground truth and the high memory demand of three-dimensional images. In this work, a CNN-based method with three-dimensional filters is demonstrated and applied to hand and brain MRI. Two modifications to an existing CNN architecture are discussed, along with methods on addressing the aforementioned challenges. While most of the existing literature on medical image segmentation focuses on soft tissue and the major organs, this work is validated on data both from the central nervous system as well as the bones of the hand.},

  abstract        = {For as long as humans have participated in the act of communication, concealing information in those communicative mediums has manifested into an art of its own. Crytographic messages, through written language or images, are a means of concealment, usually reserved for highly sensitive or compromising information. Specifically, the field of Cryptography is the construction and analysis of protocols that prevent third parties from understanding private messages. Steganography is related to Cryptography in that the goal is to obscure information using some method or algorithm, but the most important difference is that the information and the method of concealing information within Steganography both involve images--more precisely, the embedding of one image or piece of information into another image. Ever since the creation of covert communication methods, steps have been taken to crack cryptography and steganography algorithms. The desire for this rises from both human curiosity and the need to counteract adverse uses, such as encoding harmful media in inconspicuous media (phishing attack). In this paper, we succeed in cracking the Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography algorithm using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGANs) and Bayesian Optimization and compare the use of CycleGANs against Convolutional Autoencoders. The results of our experiments highlight the promising nature of CycleGANs in cracking steganography and open several possible avenues of research.},

GAN has achieved many research results in the field of computer vision and natural language processing. Image steganography is dedicated to hiding secret messages in digital images, and has achieved the purpose of covert communication. Recently, research on image steganography has demonstrated great potential for using GAN and neural networks. In this paper we review different strategies for steganography such as cover modification, cover selection and cover synthesis by GANs, and discuss the characteristics of these methods as well as evaluation metrics and provide some possible future research directions in image steganography.},

  abstract        = {The medical imaging literature has witnessed remarkable progress in high-performing segmentation models based on convolutional neural networks. Despite the new performance highs, the recent advanced segmentation models still require large, representative, and high quality annotated datasets. However, rarely do we have a perfect training dataset, particularly in the field of medical imaging, where data and annotations are both expensive to acquire. Recently, a large body of research has studied the problem of medical image segmentation with imperfect datasets, tackling two major dataset limitations: scarce annotations where only limited annotated data is available for training, and weak annotations where the training data has only sparse annotations, noisy annotations, or image-level annotations. In this article, we provide a detailed review of the solutions above, summarizing both the technical novelties and empirical results. We further compare the benefits and requirements of the surveyed methodologies and provide our recommended solutions. We hope this survey article increases the community awareness of the techniques that are available to handle imperfect medical image segmentation datasets.},

Distinct from cryptography, the steganography put emphasis on the hiding of the secret existence. The existing audio steganography methods mainly depend on human handcraft, while we proposed an audio steganography algorithm which automatically generated from adversarial training. The method consists of three neural networks: encoder which embeds the secret message in the carrier, decoder which extracts the message, and discriminator which determine the carriers contain secret messages. All the networks are simultaneously trained to create embedding, extracting and discriminating process. The system is trained with different training settings on two datasets. Competed the majority of audio steganographic schemes, the proposed scheme could produce high fidelity steganographic audio which contains secret audio. Besides, the additional experiments verify the robustness and security of our algorithm.},
